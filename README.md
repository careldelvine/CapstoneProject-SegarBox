# SegarBox -  Capstone Project

The challenges related to food systems and security are complex and urgent. The world relies on sustainable agriculture, resilient supply chains, and the availability of healthy food. In Indonesia, as an agricultural country, we benefit from this sector. But the problem is, that the market has its standards for selling agricultural products, and products that do not fulfill the standards will be discarded because of their appearance. 

In this project, we plan to create a marketplace to sell these products at lower prices. Correspondingly, we can improve the farmerâ€™s economy, and supply chain efficiency, and prevent food loss and waste.

## Personal Task
During this project, I have developed a recommendation system that 
attempts to predict the preference and find similarities between users and items purchased. This models was build with TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) in Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras. Using collaborative filtering methods and preprocessing the data using Matrix Factorization. 

### Dependency Libraries

- TensorFlow 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scann

### Installation Commands
I'm working on Microsoft OS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS so command for installating all dependancies are given below.
```bash
tensorflow:         $ sudo pip install tensorflow  
pandas:             $ sudo pip install pandas
